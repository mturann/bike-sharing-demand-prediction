The aim of this project is predict bike sharing demand under various circumstances (temperature, humidty, whether it is holiday or not etc.) by using
Machine Learning. The dataset include weather information such as temperature, humidty, wind speed, visibility, dewpoint, solar radiation, snowfall, rainfall. In addition to weather information, dataset also include the number of bikes rented per hour and date information of city of Seoul. First of all, Before starting modeling, first getting an idea on how the number of bike rentals depend on the various features provided to us. Which is called EDA process. Regression algorithms used. They are linear algorithms(linear regression, decision tree regressor), ensemble algorithms(random forest regression) and stacking algorithms(gradient boost, grid search CV) where predictions from linear and ensemble methods were used to make final predictions.
